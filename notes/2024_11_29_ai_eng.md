# Lets walk AI Engineering

```sh
cd ..
make build
```

* Lets find Simon's followers in the AIEngineering community

```sh
../.build/bsctl apply /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/simonwilson.followers.communitybuilder.yaml
```

```sh
yq '[(.items[] | select(.member == true))] | length' /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/simonwillison.followers.aiengineering.yaml
```

* So there are 991 members
* How many members in the AIAEngineering feed

```sh
yq ".items | length" /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/aiengineering.yaml
```

* 169 members pre merge

```sh
../.build/bsctl merge --dest=/Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/aiengineering.yaml \
  --source=/Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/simonwillison.followers.aiengineering.yaml \
  --source-filter=members

```

```sh
yq ".items | length" /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/aiengineering.yaml
```

* List now has 1131 members
* Lets sync it

```sh
#../.build/bsctl apply ../.build/bskylists/aiengineering.yaml
../.build/bsctl apply /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/aiengineering.yaml
```

```sh

```

# Hamel

* Lets analyze's Hamel's followers in the AIEngineering community

```sh
../.build/bsctl apply /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/hamelhusain.followers.communitybuilder.yaml
```

```sh
yq '[(.items[] | select(.member == true))] | length' /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/hamelhusain.followers.aiengineering.yaml
```

```sh
../.build/bsctl merge --dest=/Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/aiengineering.yaml \
  --source=/Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/hamelhusain.followers.aiengineering.yaml \
  --source-filter=members
```

```sh
yq ".items | length" /Users/jlewi/git_bskylists/aiengineering.yaml
```

* So Hamel added about 150 people

# Blue sky feed creator

* I tried sync'ing the list in blue sky feed creator
* That wasn't working
* I then went to settings and clicked "connect" to reconnect my bluesky account
* I then went back and refreshed the account
* THis time it increased the number of accounts from 165 to 172 but that's still far short of the ~1100 accounts that should be in the list

* I was sync'ing the wrong file
